# Three.js Project Start Template ("three": "^0.155.0")
This is a template created by Bruno Simon for starting a Three.js project.
I have created a repository to help me start my future projects more quickly.
This repo will evolve according to my way of coding.

## What I learn ?
- How modules work in JS.
- Understanding and technical terms around classes
- How start a Vite Project
- How structure a Three.js project
- Create and use a singleton

If you are interested in Three.js I can only recommend the [three.js journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) training by Bruno Simon.
